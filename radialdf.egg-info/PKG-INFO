Description: # Radial Distribution Function
        
        This package provides the radial distribution function to analyze the radial density of
        particles around other particles. The package provides a single function `inner_rdf` that
        calculates the RDF but excludes the border regions (as they would require n-dimensional
        intersection of shapes, which isn't computationally feasible).
        
        A future version, if my short attention span permits it, will provide an `rdf` function
        that handles the 2D and 3D cases with the inclusion of the border regions.
        
        ## Example
        
        ```python
        from radialdf import inner_rdf
        import numpy as np
        import plotly.graph_objs as go
        
        # Generate 10000 random particles with 3 coordinates between 0 and 100
        particles = np.random.rand(10000, 3) * 100
        # Define a volume from 0 to 100 on 3 axes
        box = [[0, 100]] * 3
        # Check the radial distribution, which should be pretty boring and flat
        g = inner_rdf(box, particles, 20, 0.2)
        go.Figure(go.Scatter(x=[i * 0.2 for i in range(21)], y=g)).show()
        ```
